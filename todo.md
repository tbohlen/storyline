- [] Clean up the Analysis progress output to make it more readible
- [] Allow the user to upload the master events list
- [] After analysis is complete, offer the user a chat interface to modify the graph
- [] Make shorter descriptions for nodes for readibility
- [] order the nodes in some way that makes sense - date or page number
- [] Differentiate between when something is mentioned in the story and when the referenced event occurs
- [] Create more cohesive timelines by making sure more events are connected in a single line. This might be doable by moving to chunk requests happening in the agent itself.
