In the spring of 1188, Sir Galahad journeyed to the ancient castle. The ancient sword gleamed in the moonlight as Sir Galahad drew it from the stone. This happened before the great coronation ceremony of King Arthur.

The knight knew that after this discovery, his quest would change forever. During the feast that followed, the other knights marveled at the weapon's power.

"This blade," said Merlin, "was forged on the fifteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord eleven hundred and eighty-eight." The prophecy spoke of events that would unfold after the sword's awakening.

Sir Galahad understood that the ancient prophecy was finally coming to pass. The sword's discovery would herald a new age of chivalry, one that would reshape the kingdom forever.
